Hey :) 

This is a React Native app that uses React, Jest for testing and the React Navigation library for seamless navigation through the app.

This app allows the user to view a subreddit of their choice.  
The user types in the word they want to see, clicks the button and is able to scroll through the posts.  
If they want to view more details about the post they are then able to click on the text and are taken to the actual reddit link.

A video demo is available in the folder - 'redditApp.MP4'.

Hope you enjoy!
