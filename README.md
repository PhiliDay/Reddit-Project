Hey :) 

This is a React Native app that uses React, Jest for testing and the React Navigation library for seamless navigation through the app.

This app allows the user to view a subreddit of their choice.

The user types in what they would like to see and is able to scroll through the related reddit posts.  

If you want to view more details about the post you can click on the text and you are taken to the actual reddit link.

A video demo is available in the folder - 'redditApp.MP4'.

Hope you enjoy!
